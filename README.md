# Personalized-Content-Recommendation-System
# User-Based Recommendation System

## Overview

This project implements a user-based recommendation system that leverages TF-IDF vectorization and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to provide personalized content recommendations based on user interactions.

## Key Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementation.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Used to transform user interactions into a format suitable for analysis.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Employed to identify similar users and generate recommendations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and creating pivot tables.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pickle**: Used for saving the trained model and matrix for future use and scalability.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Processed user interaction data to remove duplicates and ensure data integrity.
   - Created a pivot table to represent user-item interactions.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Used TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical form.
   - Implemented KNN with cosine similarity to find similar users based on their interaction history.

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Developed a function to recommend content to users based on their interactions with similar users.

4. **Model Persistence**:
   - Saved the trained KNN model and user-item interaction matrix using the Pickle library for efficient future use.

## Usage

To run the recommendation system, ensure you have the required libraries installed and then execute the main script to generate recommendations for a specific user based on their interactions.

## Conclusion

This user-based recommendation system provides a scalable and efficient way to deliver personalized content recommendations, enhancing user experience and engagement.
